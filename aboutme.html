                            <br>
                            <p>I am a senior attending South Windsor High School. Currently, I'm helping to tutor students in the creation of real-time 3D projects through Unreal Engine 5, as well as teach them topics as advanced as calculus. My hobbies include being a part of math competitions and Model UN conferences, along with playing the violin and reading dystopian novels. I also have keen interests in the science and technology fields, as I aspire to become a Computer Science major next fall.</p>
